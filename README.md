# Paradux
Board game for 2 players. A recreation of the original game with online multiplayer to play with friends from across the world.

## How to play
Each of the 2 plays picks a color, black or white. **The goal of each player is to get 4 marbles of his color in a row** in any rotation.

In a turn, the player need to **select a pair of ajasent balls of a different color** ⚫️⚪️ and then can do only one of the following acations:

- **Move** the pair 1 step together to a direction of his liking (as long as there is space for both of them without rotating them)
- **Switch** between the pair ( ⚫️⚪️ -> ⚪️⚫️ )

Once someone gets 4 marbles of his color in a row, the game ends and he is the winner.

Have fun!
